    "#### Aim of this experiment :---\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The best example of text classification is email spam detection. We have an email text, we need to detect the type of email whether the email is 'Ham' or 'Spam'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  For detecting whether the emial is 'Spam' or 'Ham', the algorithm used here is Naive Bayes Algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps used in this Algorithm:----\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Import all the necessary libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Download the necessary NLTK libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Create the Sample Dataset\n",

    "8.  Divide the dataset into training and testing data\n",

    "9.  Train the Naive Bayes Model\n",

    "10.  Make the predictions for the model\n",
