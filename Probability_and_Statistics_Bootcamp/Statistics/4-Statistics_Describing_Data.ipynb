    "## Descriptive Statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "The information (data) from your sample or population can be visualized with graphs or summarized by numbers. This will show key information in a simpler way than just looking at raw data. It can help us understand how the data is distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs can visually show the data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of graphs include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Histograms\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pie charts\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bar graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Box plots\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some graphs have a close connection to numerical summary statistics. Calculating those gives us the basis of these graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a box plot visually shows the quartiles of a data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quartiles are the data split into four equal size parts, or quarters. A quartile is one type of summary statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "Summary statistics take a large amount of information and sums it up in a few key values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numbers are calculated from the data which also describe the shape of the distributions. These are individual 'statistics'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important examples are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Mean, median and mode\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Range and interquartile range\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Quartiles and percentiles\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Standard deviation and variance"
