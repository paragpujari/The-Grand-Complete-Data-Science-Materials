    "Using statistics to make conclusions about a population is called statistical inference\n",

    "## Statistical Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics from the data in the sample is used to make conclusions about the whole population. This is a type of statistical inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability theory is used to calculate the certainty that those statistics also apply to the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a sample, there will always be some uncertainty about what the data looks like for the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty is often expressed as confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence intervals are numerical ways of showing how likely it is that the true value of this statistic is within a certain range for the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a another way of checking if a statement about a population is true. More precisely, it checks how likely it is that a hypothesis is true is based on the sample data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of statements or questions that can be checked with hypothesis testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  People in the Netherlands taller than people in Denmark\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Do people prefer Pepsi or Coke?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Does a new medicine cure a disease?"
