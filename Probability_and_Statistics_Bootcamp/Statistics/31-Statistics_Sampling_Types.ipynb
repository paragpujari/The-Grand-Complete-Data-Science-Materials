    "## Different Types of Sampling Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Random Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "A random sample is where every member of the population has an equal chance to be chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Convenience Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "A convenience sample is where the participants that are the easiest to reach are chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Systematic Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "A systematic sample is where the participants are chosen by some regular system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Stratified Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "A stratified sample is where the population is split into smaller groups called 'strata'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'strata' can, for example, be based on demographics, like:\n",
    "\n",
    " (i)  Different age groups\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii)  Professions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Stratification of a sample is the first step. Another sampling method (like random sampling) is used for the second step of choosing participants from all of the smaller groups (strata).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Clustered Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "A clustered sample is where the population is split into smaller groups called 'clusters'.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clusters are usually natural, like different cities in a country.\n",
    "\n",
    "The clusters are chosen randomly for the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "All members of the clusters can participate in the sample, or members can be chosen randomly from the clusters in a third step"
