    "## Statistics - Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a formal way of checking if a hypothesis about a population is true or not\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothesis is a claim about a population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothesis test is a formal procedure to check if a hypothesis is true or not\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ex:--\n",
    "\n",
    "The average height of people in Denmark is more than 170 cm\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Null Hypothesis(H0):  \n",
    "\n",
    "The average height of people in Denmark is 170cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternate Hypothesis(H1): \n",
    "\n",
    "The average height of people in Denmark is more than 170cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Significance Level\n",
    "\n",
    "The significance level is the uncertainty we accept when rejecting the null hypothesis in the hypothesis test\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Test Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "The test statistic is used to decide the outcome of the hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test statistic is a standardized value calculated from the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common examples are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.   Standard Normal Distribution (Z)\n",
    "\n",
    "2.   Student's T-Distribution (T)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Critical Value and P-Value Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main approaches used for hypothesis tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The critical value approach compares the test statistic with the critical value of the significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The p-value approach compares the p-value of the test statistic and with the significance level\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Critical Value Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical value approach checks if the test statistic is in the rejection region.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rejection region is an area of probability in the tails of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size of the rejection region is decided by the significance level alpha.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The P-Value Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value approach checks if the p-value of the test statistic is smaller than the significance level\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value of the test statistic is the area of probability in the tails of the distribution from the value of the test statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps for a Hypothesis Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The following steps are used for a hypothesis test:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Check the conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Define the claims\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Decide the significance level\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Calculate the test statistic\n",
    "\n",
