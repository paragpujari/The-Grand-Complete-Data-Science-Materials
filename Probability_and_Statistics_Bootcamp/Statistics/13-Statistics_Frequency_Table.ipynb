    "### Frequency Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequency means the number of times a value appears in the data. A table can quickly show us how many times each value appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the data has many different values, it is easier to use intervals of values to present them in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the age of the 934 Nobel Prize winners up until the year 2020. In the table each row is an age interval of 10 years.\n",

    "## Relative Frequency Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative frequency means the number of times a value appears in the data compared to the total amount. A percentage is a relative frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the relative frequencies of ages of Noble Prize winners. Now, all the frequencies are divided by the total (934) to give percentages.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Cumulative Frequency Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Cumulative frequency counts up to a particular value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the cumulative frequencies of ages of Nobel Prize winners. Now, we can see how many winners have been younger than a certain age."
