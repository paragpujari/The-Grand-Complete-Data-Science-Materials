    "## Measurement Levels\n",
    "\n",
    "The main types of data are Qualitative (categories) and Quantitative (numerical). These are further split into the following measurement levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "These measurement levels are also called measurement 'scales'\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Nominal Level\n",
    "\n",
    "Categories (qualitative data) without any order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "(i)  Brand names\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii)  Countries\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii)  Colors\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Ordinal level\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Categories that can be ordered (from low to high), but the precise \"distance\" between each is not meaningful\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "(i)  Letter grade scales from F to A\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) Military ranks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Interval Level\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data that can be ordered and the distance between them is objectively meaningful. But there is no natural 0-value where the scale originates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "(i)  Years in a calendar\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) Temperature measured in Fahrenheit\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Ratio Level \n",
    "\n",
    "Data that can be ordered and there is a consistent and meaningful distance between them. And it also has a natural 0-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "(i)  Money\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii)  Age\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) Time\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data that is on the ratio level (or \"ratio scale\") gives us the most detailed information"
